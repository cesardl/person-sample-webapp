Some words of the author 

    "Simple CRUD - SpringMVC & Hibernate" is just simple (there's no complex business rule) and built using SpringMVC and Hibernate3. You're free to use or alter this code for whatever your intentions :)
    
    Requirements:
    - Netbeans 6.5
    - Application Server (e.g. Glassfish2)
    - MySql 5
    
    Steps to run:
    1. extract Simple CRUD - SpringMVC & Hibernate3.zip
    2. open project using netbeans 6.5
    3. resolve missing library by adding below library (available from http://commons.apache.org/)
    -commons-pool.jar
    -commons-dbcp.jar
    ****4. run script at project_folder/docs/ddl_dml.sql
    5. run project..
    6. that's all...
